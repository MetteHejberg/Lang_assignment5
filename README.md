Link to repository: https://github.com/MetteHejberg/Lang_assignment5

This assignment is inspired by Sagae's (2021) paper, where they build a recurrent neural network that tracks children's age and syntactic development. The goal of their paper, was to provide a more data-driven and reproducible alternative to the models currently in use to predict and evaluate children's age in terms of their language skills.
